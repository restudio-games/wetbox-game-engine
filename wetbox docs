📚 Wetbox Game Engine Documentation
🚀 Welcome to Wetbox Docs!
🛠️ How to use Wetbox?
🔗 Go to GitHub:

https://github.com/restudio-games/wetbox-game-engine

📂 Open the file editor.html and copy all the code.

🖥️ On your desktop (Windows):

👉 Right-click → New → Text Document
✍️ Name your document anything you like, for example:
my-first-wetbox-game
📋 Open the new document and paste the copied code inside.
💾 Save the file with a .html extension, for example:
my-first-wetbox-game.html
🌐 You will see an icon of a web browser. Double-click it to run.
🎉 Congrats! The engine is now running.

✏️ You can edit the code using any code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.

⚙️ What if the engine is incomplete?
Wetbox relies on Plugins ⚡.

🔗 Go to GitHub again:
https://github.com/restudio-games/wetbox-game-engine

📂 Open the file plugin (very important).html

📋 Copy the plugin code you want.

📌 Paste the plugin code inside the main engine code (editor.html) in the proper place.

🚀 Enjoy your enhanced engine!

⚠️ Developer Notes (eng)
If the plugin code contains a function named createScene(), rename it to avoid conflicts with the engine’s main createScene() function.
